# JobFinder

JobFinder is a simple job search application implemented in multiple programming languages.  
The repository demonstrates how the same core functionality can be written in different languages for comparison and learning purposes.

---

## Overview

This project includes implementations of the JobFinder application in several languages, including:

- Java
- Go
- Python
- C++
- JavaScript
- Kotlin
- PHP
- Rust
- Swift

Each file contains a standalone version of the application written in its respective language.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Compare syntax and structure across languages
- Demonstrate equivalent logic implementations
- Provide learning examples for developers exploring new languages

---

## Running the Application

Since each implementation is standalone, use the appropriate compiler or interpreter for the language you want to run.

Examples:

### Java
```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
